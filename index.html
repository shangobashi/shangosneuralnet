                <h2>Sparks in the Sandstorm: A Letter To Myself</h2>

                <p>There's a kind of story people expect from founders.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>A clean origin.<br>
                    A neat arc.<br>
                    A single moment where the hero "decides" and everything changes.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>But Real life doesn't work like that. And Real Rebuilding doesn't either.</p>

                <p>~</p>

                <p>What I have, as far as founder stories go, is less cinematic and more mechanical: a person in a sandstorm, keeping their eyes fixed on a direction they chose, fighting to take step after step, refusing to let noise become destiny.</p>

                <p>The only thing animating them? <strong>Sparks.</strong></p>

                <p>Not motivation. Not discipline-as-a-meme. Sparks: the small, repeatable ignition that keeps one moving when they can't seem to see far ahead.</p>

                <p>~</p>

                <p>This is the operating system I'm running now. This is the end of one arc, the beginning of another, and the philosophy behind why I'm doing what I'm doing.</p>

                <p>I'm writing this as a founder, not as a candidate for employment.</p>

                <p>Employability is irrelevant to what I'm building.</p>

                <p>And what is it that I'm building? Well, glad you asked. I'm building a machine. And that's that.</p>

                <p>~</p>

                <h3>1) The world doesn't need more "AI." It needs systems that can act.</h3>

                <p>"AI" is now a diluted word. It means too many things.</p>

                <p>It can mean a chatbot that writes a paragraph. It can mean autocomplete. It can mean agents. It can mean deep learning. It can mean hallucinations wrapped in a pretty UI.</p>

                <p>I'm not interested in "AI" as a vibe.</p>

                <p>I'm interested in systems—software that can do work reliably, repeatedly, under constraints.</p>

                <p>And in that world, the real frontier isn't "talking." It's <strong>acting</strong>.</p>

                <p>Agentic systems—real ones—are not just a model response. They're workflows where software can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>plan steps</li>
                    <li>use tools</li>
                    <li>call APIs</li>
                    <li>read and write data</li>
                    <li>retry intelligently when things fail</li>
                    <li>respect constraints</li>
                    <li>produce repeatable outcomes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That's where value lives. Not in demos. Not in glossy threads. In <strong>executed work</strong>.</p>

                <p>So my main objective obviously had to be: <strong>master agentic systems engineering.</strong></p>

                <p>Not the aesthetic. The engineering.</p>

                <p>And I hadn't even read "Accelerando" back then yet, mind you. (Lord would that book break the limits of possibilities in my mind.)</p>

                <h3>2) Why I needed mastery across the whole spectrum</h3>

                <p>Peeps underestimate how wide the foundation has to be if you want to build agentic systems that aren't fragile little shiny toys.</p>

                <p>An agent isn't a single skill (or a zipfile of skills as we seem to be doing now). It's a stack.</p>

                <p>You need to understand (at least!):</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>web systems (so you can ship interfaces and operational products)</li>
                    <li>backend systems (APIs, services, integrations, auth, workflows)</li>
                    <li>databases and data modeling (because agents need memory and structured truth)</li>
                    <li>data engineering (because agents need reliable pipelines and consistent inputs)</li>
                    <li>machine learning and deep learning (so you understand what the model is and what it isn't)</li>
                    <li>systems thinking (because real workflows have constraints, failure modes, and lifecycle realities)</li>
                    <li>security (because DUH but also because tool-using systems are obvious attack surfaces)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is why I didn't go narrow.</p>

                <p>I went wide, deliberately, because I want to build something durable.</p>

                <p>The goal obviously wasn't to become "a person who knows many things." I've always liked my glasses half empty than full of crap.</p>

                <p>Nah, the goal was to become a person who can build agentic systems end-to-end, without needing an entire organization around them to make progress. Eliminate the middle-men. All of them. Yes, web3's core philosophies really resonated with me — and they still do, even if the entire space has completely forgotten about them.</p>

                <h3>3) The sandstorm: what it feels like when you rebuild seriously</h3>

                <p>When you commit to a long arc, you eventually hit a phase where <em>everything</em> becomes noise:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Too many technologies;<br>
                    Too many opinions;<br>
                    Too many tool releases;<br>
                    Too many "experts";<br>
                    Too many tweets.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Even your own mind becomes a source of noise:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I'm soooo onto something."<br>
                    "I'm completely delusional."<br>
                    "Maybe I should switch direction..."<br>
                    "I should build something else. This has been done a million times."<br>
                    "I should just start from scratch."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I've spent quite a bit of time stuck inside life's most difficult phases to recognize what that is.</p>

                <blockquote><p>It's not truth.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p>It's weather.</p></blockquote>

                <p>The answer isn't inspiration. The answer is orientation. The answer is: keeping sight of your goal in a complete sandstorm.</p>

                <p>That's where sparks come in.</p>

                <p>A spark is not a grand breakthrough. It's a tiny ignition:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>a finished unit<br>
                    a shipped artifact<br>
                    a solved bug<br>
                    a clean refactor<br>
                    a working integration<br>
                    a new tool wired into a system correctly<br>
                    a workflow that now runs end-to-end<br>
                    quite frankly, anything that counts as a step forward.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Sparks keep you moving when you can't see the summit.</p>

                <p>And friend, don't ever forget that just because you can't see it anymore, that summit is still there. Waiting on you to keep pushing through.</p>

                <h3>4) The part people misunderstand: I didn't "pause" during the injury</h3>

                <p>It's easy for people to read "spinal injury" and assume "lost years."</p>

                <p>But that's not how it went. At least not in my case.</p>

                <p>Yes, there was physical pain. Excruciating physical pain. Let me spare you the accompanying mental purgatory. And yes, there was restriction. Yes, there was darkness. Utter, complete and abysmal darkness.</p>

                <p>But I didn't sit still in that hole. Nope ser.</p>

                <p>I learned to abstract pain out of my identity, and I trained myself to keep moving mentally even when my body wasn't cooperating. It sounds easy written like this — it wasn't. But the choice given to me was binary; and in face of 0, I'll always pick 1.</p>

                <p>So during those years, I became obsessive about the only kind of learning that really matters: the kind that survives adversity.</p>

                <p>Little by little, from book to book, psychology, medicine and philosophy turned into politics and history before finally landing on finance. Realms I'd never had the time to explore fully, in leasure. Finance especially; I'd always been allergic to money and numbers. I was an artist through and through.</p>

                <p>But then, I got hit by the bug. Suddenly, my love for Maths came back, with the understanding of an actual application for them that made sense to me. And to my pockets. Those things were getting smaller by the day (I was immobilized after all). In Finance, Math made sense. Of course, it did in all the other aspects of Life I had encountered so far, even in Music; but none of these applications seemed to make as much sense to my mind than in Finance. So <em>that's</em> why they found it interesting to count dices and call it "probability".</p>

                <p>They never teach you Finance in High school. And that should tell you everything you need to know about the educational system and their actual desire to give you the means to understand Life as it actually is. Anyways, don't let me ramble on that subject.</p>

                <p>Finance bug bit me, and for roughly 4.5 years straight, I traded 18 hours a day, every day, with only one day off.</p>

                <p>I wasn't doing that because it was glamorous. I was doing it because it gave me the most brutally honest feedback loop I've ever seen:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>you're right or you're wrong<br>
                    your model works or it doesn't<br>
                    your discipline holds or it collapses<br>
                    your emotions get trained or you get destroyed</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>At the same time, I was absorbing crypto, finance, economics, market structure, and Web3 history and lore—deeply. Literally living my life inside CT Spaces and Discord servers. I was there when they started selling apes on the chain and everybody got rich until they realized they were mass-marketing racist pictures; I was there when Luna crashed and I was there again when Do streamed with Martin and Su in what seemed like the most web3 moment ever — until Milei's pazzi went onto Coffezilla and spilled the beans on the entire memecoins scam industry. Fun times. I traded throughout, learning my one and only main goal, money really a side-effect, absorbing as much about markets psychology as I could. I recommend trading at least 1 month in your life to every human on earth.</p>

                <p>It teaches one a lot about oneself.</p>

                <p>That's what I was busy doing while most people would have dissolved.</p>

                <p>So when I later pivoted back into pure tech and engineering, it wasn't a random reinvention.</p>

                <p>It was a continuation. A different expression of the same mind.</p>

                <p>I had stopped the engine for a moment; it was time to start it back up.</p>

                <h3>5) The pivot: from market obsession to engineering obsession</h3>

                <p>At some point, I stopped trading to refocus on completing the path I knew I needed to finish.</p>

                <p>That was in ~May — when the "certifications sprint" really began. I needed, this time, a structured way; a definite point-of-arrival in sight; intermediary small fries with a final boss to kill.</p>

                <p>The idea was simple:</p>

                <p>If I want to build agentic systems that can act in the world, I need mastery across the whole computational spectrum.</p>

                <p>So I ran a marathon like a sprint.</p>

                <p>And now I'm at the end of that learning arc.</p>

                <p>In the next few hours, I'll have closed the loop. Last certs, last classes. (Then I might pop open a beer or two.)</p>

                <p>Not because certifications are magic. They aren't. Proof is what matters.</p>

                <p>But the sprint mattered for one reason:</p>

                <p><strong>It gave me coverage.</strong></p>

                <p>A 360-degree map of the terrain.</p>

                <p>The verbiage. The concepts. The workflow structure. The "how things connect."</p>

                <p>Not so I can talk about it.</p>

                <p>But so I can <strong>build correctly</strong>.</p>

                <h3>6) A note about inference (and why I'm not romantic about it)</h3>

                <p>I'll say it plainly: I don't love inference as a subject.</p>

                <p>I learned it because I wanted a complete understanding of the ML creation process—especially the vocabulary and logic people use when they're doing serious work.</p>

                <p>It's important to understand what it is and how it fits.</p>

                <p>But it's not my obsession.</p>

                <p>My obsession is <strong>engineering systems that ship</strong>.</p>

                <p>Learning isn't the mission. Building is. And it might have taken what some might consider a "long" time; I have never deluded myself into forgetting about it.</p>

                <p>Time to get back on it.</p>

                <h3>7) The new phase: build velocity, build proof</h3>

                <p>My next phase is not "learn more."</p>

                <p>It's to build more, with ruthless throughput:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>1 MVP every 3/day<br>
                    1 chosen product finished and ready to ship per week</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>That cadence isn't a motivational quote. It's a constraint. And it begins next week.</p>

                <p>Constraints create clarity. Clarity creates output.</p>

                <p>And output is what will turn this from a personal arc into an actual [s-word]...</p>

                <p>I'm done optimizing for being "well-rounded." For "knows what he's talking about". For "can be trusted".</p>

                <p>I'm now optimizing for <strong>shipping</strong>.</p>

                <h3>8) Why the agent fleet matters (and what it means in practice)</h3>

                <p>I'm not doing the "agents" thing because it's trendy.</p>

                <p>I'm doing it because it's the natural next step once you realize the bottleneck isn't ideas.</p>

                <p>And I'm also doing it because I never stopped doing it; that idea was the initial spark that began this whole thing; it did not come yesterday, it did not come the year before; I've been working on it on the hush ever since chatGPT came out and I realized the dream was finally within reach and grasp and that, at the time, no one seemed to even be able to fathom it. Of course, today, everyone is building agentic systems; openclaw is on everyone's mind; one might even think that the ship has sailed. Not me though. My initial edge (idea) remains untouched; these agents still aren't it.</p>

                <p>The bottleneck remains execution throughput under quality constraints.</p>

                <p>A serious fleet of agents is not a gimmick. It's an internal organization:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>specialized roles<br>
                    tool boundaries<br>
                    workflows<br>
                    review loops<br>
                    evaluation<br>
                    documentation<br>
                    replayability<br>
                    versioning<br>
                    audit trails<br>
                    failure handling</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In other words: it's not "agents."</p>

                <p>It's a <strong>factory</strong>.</p>

                <p>And if I can build a factory that produces correct work quickly, then the limiting factor becomes product choice and distribution—not labor capacity.</p>

                <p>That's the goal: turn execution into a machine.</p>

                <h3>9) One thing left to complete the picture: blockchain engineering</h3>

                <p>There's one remaining area I may (definitely will) formalize in March: blockchain engineering.</p>

                <p>Not because I need more variety (hell — I don't).</p>

                <p>But because if agents are going to operate in the world, they will need to transact.</p>

                <p>I already have the domain knowledge: crypto markets, finance, economics, the history and dynamics of Web3.</p>

                <p>What I lack on that side is the deep coding mastery: Solidity (and whatnot; probably Rust), contract design, on-chain execution patterns.</p>

                <p>I did a few classes years ago. The EVM, Near, Bitcoin basics. That's not enough. Also, I've forgotten most of it.</p>

                <p>It's time to master that stack properly. From first principles, which I now got down.</p>

                <p>So yeah — I'm confident I can, because something changed during this sprint: my learning speed has gone up sharply. (Which is normal really). I learned R in a few hours yesterday. I'm not saying that to brag. I'm saying it because the muscle is real and working now:</p>

                <blockquote><p>Once you've built enough mental scaffolding, new languages become syntax + patterns, not "new worlds."</p></blockquote>

                <p>So blockchain engineering is a practical next step if I want agents that can operate with real economic power.</p>

                <h3>10) The real founder story: refusing to become a Victim of Time</h3>

                <p><em>(also a super nice song title idea; feel free to steal it before I use it!)</em></p>

                <p>Here's what this really is, stripped of all branding.</p>

                <blockquote><p>It's a refusal to let time happen to me.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p>Most people drift. They don't choose arcs. They let the current decide.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p>I'm doing the opposite.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>I'm choosing an arc, building the machine to execute it,<br>
                    and refusing to be thrown off course by noise.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>And I think that's what founders are, at their best:</p>

                <blockquote><p>Not people with ideas.</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p>People with the ability to turn Direction into Reality.</p></blockquote>

                <h3>11) What I'm building now (philosophically, not as a feature list)</h3>

                <p>I'm building an engine that can:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>take goals<br>
                    decompose them into workflows<br>
                    use tools<br>
                    interact with data<br>
                    recover from failure<br>
                    remain observable and debuggable<br>
                    improve over time through iteration</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Some projects will be general agent orchestration.</p>

                <p>Some will be focused on crypto tooling and exchange workflows, because that environment is a ruthless testbed: fast feedback, real incentives, and no mercy.</p>

                <p>But the deeper mission is consistent:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Build systems that act.</p>
                    <p>Build systems that compound.</p>
                    <p>Build systems that can be trusted.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>12) Closing: Sparks, Again</h3>

                <p>People love to dress founders in mythology.</p>

                <p>I prefer mechanics.</p>

                <p>When you can't see far ahead, you don't need a grand story.</p>

                <p>You need sparks.</p>

                <p>Small ignition, repeatable.</p>

                <p>A system that runs. A workflow that succeeds. A tool integration that holds. A product artifact that exists.</p>

                <p>Sparks are how you cross long distances through sandstorms.</p>

                <p>And now, with the learning arc closing, the next chapter is simple:</p>

                <p><strong>Build.</strong></p>

                <p>Every day.</p>

                <p>One MVP every ~3 day.</p>

                <p>One shippable product every week.</p>

                <p>And a growing fleet of agents to keep the machine moving faster than a human could alone.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>No more waiting for clarity.</p>
                    <p>Clarity will be produced by output.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>That's the manifesto.</p>

                <h2>Keeping Sight of the Goal in a Complete Sandstorm</h2>

                <p>I don't really know how to write this without it sounding dramatic, so I'll just say it plainly.</p>

                <p>In 2019, I broke my back.<br>
                The years that followed were not "a setback." They were a different life. Rehab from 2019 to 2024. A long stretch where time moves weird and progress is microscopic, and you're forced to learn patience the hard way.</p>

                <p>Then I got my life back.</p>

                <p>And once I did, I made a decision that probably looks insane from the outside: I was going to rebuild everything, fast, on purpose, with intention. Not with vibes. With systems.</p>

                <h3>The rebuild started like an engineering problem</h3>

                <p>I didn't want to "learn to code." I didn't want to be someone who collects tutorials and talks about frameworks. I wanted to become the kind of builder teams can trust with real work: systems that ship, systems that stay up, systems that don't crumble the second reality shows up.</p>

                <p>So I set a target and I treated it like a project plan.</p>

                <p>The target is simple to say and hard to execute:</p>

                <p><strong>Full-stack delivery + data engineering reliability + ML readiness + systems thinking.</strong><br>
                Robotics in 2026.</p>

                <p>That's not a slogan. That's the throughline. Everything I pick is in service of that.</p>

                <h3>The last seven months were a controlled burn</h3>

                <p>People ask me how I did it and I never know what to answer because the truth sounds like a lie.</p>

                <p>I went into an immersion cycle. A controlled burn.<br>
                <strong>150-hour weeks.</strong><br>
                Study, build, repeat. All signal, minimal noise.</p>

                <p>Not because I'm trying to impress anyone with a number. I'm saying it because it explains why the timeline looks so compressed. It explains why the output comes in waves. It's not magic. It's volume and structure.</p>

                <h3>I just earned the Data Engineer Professional Certification</h3>

                <p>One of the big milestones I hit recently is the <strong>Codecademy Data Engineer Professional Certification</strong>.</p>

                <p>And I'm going to say something that might offend people who treat "data" like a boring side quest:</p>

                <p>Data engineering is the spine.</p>

                <p>It's the difference between "we have an AI feature" and "this thing actually works." It's the difference between a model demo and a product. It's pipelines, SQL depth, transformations, modeling instincts, and correctness under change.</p>

                <p>Most people skip it because it's not sexy.<br>
                I leaned into it because I'm serious.</p>

                <h3>I also completed the Computer Science Professional Certification</h3>

                <p>I also completed the <strong>Computer Science Professional Certification</strong> because I wanted the anchor. The rigor. The fundamentals that keep you honest when the product becomes chaotic and the system scales.</p>

                <p>I have zero interest in being a fragile builder who can only operate inside the comfort zone of a tutorial. Fundamentals are the antidote.</p>

                <h3>My online presence looks messy because I'm not optimizing for "clean"</h3>

                <p>If you've followed me on Twitter, you know my feed can look… unpredictable.</p>

                <p>Crypto airdrops. Tool trials. Weird flipped-text bios. Little personal voids. "Chunky hedge" hints. Random posts that feel like I'm talking to myself.</p>

                <p>From the outside it can look chaotic.</p>

                <p>But it's not random. It's consistent in a way that's hard to see unless you understand how I work.</p>

                <p>I'm always probing systems. I'm always running experiments. I'm always trying to extract rules from noise. Sometimes that means code. Sometimes that means markets. Sometimes that means human behavior. Sometimes it means art.</p>

                <p>Same habit. Different surface.</p>

                <h3>I'm skeptical of hype, including AI hype</h3>

                <p>I don't care who says what. I don't care if it's a billionaire or a doom prophet or an optimist selling salvation.</p>

                <p>I'm not building a worldview.<br>
                I'm building a skill stack that survives constraints.</p>

                <p>I'm interested in what survives contact with reality.</p>

                <h3>My "non-tech" background is not a detour, it's training</h3>

                <p>Before I got locked into this trajectory, I lived other lives.</p>

                <p>Sound engineering taught me precision. Reliability. Signal and noise. The humility of systems that break if you're sloppy.</p>

                <p>Music taught me end-to-end thinking. It's not just "make the beat." It's the pipeline: tools, iteration, feedback loops, mixing, mastering, artwork, marketing, release. You ship or you disappear.</p>

                <p>And yes, I had a law school detour. That taught me what doesn't fit. Music taught me what won't let go. Engineering became the bridge that can carry both.</p>

                <p>If you want a single sentence that explains how my brain works, it's this:</p>

                <p>I'm always trying to build a complete pipeline from idea to execution.</p>

                <h3>Blue Swarm: building with a team of 60+ agents</h3>

                <p>One thing I'm actively building right now is <strong>Blue Swarm</strong>: a cohesive team of 60+ agents working together across planning, coding, review, testing, and documentation.</p>

                <p>Not for hype. Not for vibes.<br>
                For throughput and quality.</p>

                <p>It's basically me asking: what happens when you treat "execution" itself like a system you can design?</p>

                <p>That's what I care about. Not aesthetics. Not slogans. Output.</p>

                <h3>Sparks: the operating system</h3>

                <p>I wrote this before and I still mean it:</p>

                <p><strong>Keeping sight of your goal in a complete sandstorm. Biggest skill I earned this year. How? Sparks.</strong></p>

                <p>Sparks are those tiny moments that keep you moving when everything is noisy, unclear, and heavy. Not motivation. Not inspiration. Sparks.</p>

                <p>You collect them. You protect them. You use them to keep the trajectory.</p>

                <h3>Where this is going</h3>

                <p>Here's where I'm at now:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Full-stack delivery is real.</li>
                    <li>Data engineering is now certified.</li>
                    <li>Computer science foundations are anchored.</li>
                    <li>The ML / data science cluster is being closed deliberately.</li>
                    <li>Systems thinking is becoming the thread that ties it all together.</li>
                    <li>Robotics is still the 2026 horizon.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I'm building in public until the output speaks louder than any bio.</p>

                <p>If you're a startup and you need someone who can ship and still care about correctness, reliability, and systems design, you already know what to do.</p>

                <p>And if you're just watching: keep watching. The next artifacts will make the story obvious.</p>
